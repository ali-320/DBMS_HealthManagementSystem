This dataset, sourced from the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology 
and Allied Hospital (Punjab, Pakistan), comprises 299 patient records 
with 13 clinical and lifestyle features—ideal for 
building, training, and testing predictive models.

It is the most suitable for a prototype, however it has following limitations:
Small N (299) → limited generalization, high variance, risk of overfitting.

Cross-sectional (no high-resolution time series) → not ideal for sequence-based anomaly detection.

Single center → potential bias; model may not generalize to different hospitals/populations.

Additional datasets for improvement are mentioned in the future.txt.
