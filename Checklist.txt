1. Build the SQL databse. (Done)
2. Create pythong code to insert data into the SQL databsea. (Done)
3. Select the AI models to train:
    Possible selections:
    i. Isolation forest: Unsupervised anomaly detection based on vitals and labs data.
    Detects outliers in vitals/labs.
    ii. Dense Autoencoder: Unsupervised reconstruction based anomaly detection on vitals and labs.
    Identifies complex multivariate anomalies.
    iii. XG Boost classifier: Supervised classification to predict morality using a broader set of features.
    Other selections:
    i. Random forest.
    ii. Logistic Regression.
    iii. LSTM (for sequential patient monitoring).
4. Prepare data for their training.
5. Train the models.
6. Test the models.
7. Make the alerts of models to appear in the SQL DB.
