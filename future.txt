1. For scaling up options, open chat gpt, with mhali... account, open the chat
SQL project b, and ask it of DBMS_AI_Health_ScaleUp.

Additional datasets that can improve performance are given below:
Use these to augment training, pretrain models, or test transfer learning / domain adaptation.)

    MIMIC-IV / MIMIC-III (ICU time-series) — high-resolution vitals, labs, notes. Great for learning physiologic patterns and building sequence models.

    eICU-CRD — multi-centre ICU dataset (complementary to MIMIC).

    HiRID — dense ICU time-series (Europe).

    Kaggle cardiac / heart failure datasets — additional tabular datasets for mortality/cardiac event prediction.

    Country/regional datasets (DHS / WHO / Pakistan health surveys) — for demographic context and calibration.

    Synthetic time-series / data augmentation — if privacy or availability limits you, generate synthetic patient sequences (GANs, TimeGAN) to pretrain sequence models.

Strategy for combining:

    Use Pakistan heart dataset for final prototype demonstrations (domain match).

    Pretrain sequence models or anomaly detectors on MIMIC/eICU, then fine-tune or calibrate with any local (Pakistan) data available. This gives better sensitivity to physiologic anomalies while keeping local relevance.
