Test #1:
Successfully, pulled and pushed repo from github on my local disk
using HTTPS.

Test #2:
Successfully created the database structure in MySQL.

Test #3:
Trying to get the data from csv to SQL, but got error in version. Now,
created a .venv file (a virtual environment) that doesn't access the global
python but takes the python version, installed in this virtual environment.

Test #4:
Redo test #3. I got an error, as the name of columns was different.

Test #5:
Corrected names but still got error because of _id can't be added in heart_data
without being in patients.

Test #6:
Added the data in pateints table. Now about to run the code again. This time the
code ran with my own modifications. The data of patients has been stored in the heart_data
table.
